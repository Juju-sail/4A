My job: about 4 minutes.

After a rapid description of the company, you will describe your job: What you do, the qualities and skills required (see doc on skills), why these skills, a typical day, what is difficult, what you like the most / the least … How it has evolved since you started. You can also compare it to one of the jobs from the videos. Your talk needs to be structured.

Do not forget to conclude.

You should not need a visual but can use one if it helps. Think of this as a part of a job interview for another job.
